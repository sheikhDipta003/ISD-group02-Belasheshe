We have to create a separate class for each database table in the files models.py. For example, tables 3,5,6,7,9,13 will be created in the file doctors/models.py. tables 1,2,4,11 will be in residents/models.py. And rest of them will be in nurses/models.py.

Views:
1) doctors app [doctors/views.py]
- dashboard
- profile
- ResidentStatus
- PrescriptionCreate
- PrescriptionDetails
- PrescriptionUpdate
- PrescriptionDelete
- RestrictionCreate
- RestrictionDetails
- RestrictionUpdate
- RestrictionDelete
- NurseScheduleCreate
- NurseScheduleUpdate
- NurseScheduleDelete
- NurseScheduleDetails
- CheckupReportDetails

2) nurses app [nurses/views.py]
- dashboard
- profile
- NurseSchedule
- AssignedResidentsList
- AssignedResidentsDetails
- CheckupReportCreate
- CheckupReportUpdate
- PrescriptionDetails

3) residents app [residents/views.py]
- dashboard
- ResidentStatus
- PrescriptionList

Similarly, write separate functions for each of the views listed in corresponding .py file. 

HTML files:
- html files will be placed in doctors/templates/doctors/, nurses/templates/nurses/ and residents/templates/residents/ folders respectively.
- We have to create one html file for each of the views for that particular app (doctors,nurses and residents).

Version-1 of Dashboard and ResidentStatus views for residents app.


--------------------------------  Workflow  -------------------------------

1) Created the three models Member,ResidentMedCond and MemberAppoint in residents/models.py


2) Then I have run 'python manage.py makemigrations' which will create the backend SQL code for creating the tables.
 After that, by running 'python manage.py migrate', django will execute these backend codes and thus create the three tables.

***Install viewflow using 'pip install django-viewflow --pre' BEFORE RUNNING THE MIGRATIONS***

3) Then I opened cmd prompt and run 'python manage.py shell' to open the python shell. In there, I executed these commands
 one-by-one:
	(1) from residents.models import Member	=> import Member table from the DB
	(2) mem1 = Member(Member_ID=100,Room_no=200,Name='Jon',Address='someaddress, dhaka',Email='321@gmail.com',
	Phone='0187781919',DOB='1955-03-15',Religion='Islam',Account_no='9388181010')		=> create a new member with the
	 given field values
	(3) mem1.save()		=> save this entry in DB
	(4) Member.objects.all()	=> verify
	(5) exit()  => to exit python shell


4) Created classes DashboardView and ResidentPhyStatusView in residents/views.py. 

By saying template_name = 'residents/dashboard.html', I am telling djano to use the html file templates/residents/dashboard.html
 to render this webpage.

Similarly for template_name = 'residents/phyStat.html'.

5) Next, created the html files - templates/residents/dashboard.html and templates/residents/phyStat.html.

And the necessary css and js files are located inside static/residents folder.

5) Finally, I have the database tables and I have the html files. Next, I have to tell django the different routes that a it must
 use to direct user to different webpage. This is done by modifying residents/urls.py and belasheshe/urls.py.

6) Now, by running 'python manage.py runserver' at cmd prompt and typing http://127.0.0.1:8000/residents/ at the browser, I am able
 to see the website.
